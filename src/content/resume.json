      "Senior technology leader with 15+ years driving innovation across DevOps, Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), Security Operations (SecOps), and Cloud Platform Architecture. Early adopter and evangelist of transformative technologies — championed Docker containerization and Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC) before industry-wide adoption, and pioneered AI-driven operations by building and managing a fully autonomous AI engineering team two years before agentic AI frameworks were formalized. Proven record of architecting globally distributed systems, eliminating toil through automation, and leading security-first infrastructure strategies.",
      "Active open-source contributor and framework author. Publishing the Agentic ecosystem (polyglot AI agent orchestration across TypeScript, Python, and Rust), Extended Data Library (production Python data toolkit with 5 PyPI packages), and Strata Game Library (React Three Fiber game framework). Building tools that bridge the gap between AI research and production engineering."
