# jbcom Vision & Mission

## Mission

Build composable, well-documented tools that solve real problems. Every package in the jbcom ecosystem is extracted from production systems—code that works, shared openly.

## Principles

### Production-First
No toy examples. Every package solves problems encountered in real systems.

### Composable
Small, focused packages that work together. Use what you need.

### Well-Documented
Clear APIs, comprehensive examples, and honest limitations.

## Overview

The jbcom ecosystem consists of **20+ open source packages** for:

- **AI orchestration** - Agent fleet management, crew configuration, and intelligent automation
- **Procedural graphics** - 3D terrain generation, water systems, and atmospheric effects
- **Enterprise infrastructure** - Cloud connectors, secrets management, and DevOps tooling
- **Developer libraries** - Data structures, configuration, logging, and utilities

All packages are production-tested, well-documented, and designed to work together. They're built with TypeScript, Python, Go, and Terraform—the languages and tools used in real engineering teams.

## Multi-Language Ecosystem

The jbcom ecosystem spans multiple languages, each chosen for its strengths:

- **TypeScript** - Frontend, 3D graphics, and modern web applications
- **Python** - AI/ML, data processing, and enterprise integrations
- **Go** - High-performance services and Kubernetes operators
- **Terraform** - Infrastructure as code and cloud automation

## Categories

### AI & Agents
Orchestration, fleet management, and intelligent automation

Key packages: agentic-control, agentic-crew, agentic-triage

### Game Development
Procedural graphics, game engines, and interactive experiences

Key packages: strata, Rivermarsh, Otterfall

### Infrastructure
Enterprise connectors, secrets, and DevOps tooling

Key packages: vendor-connectors, SecretSync, terraform-repository-automation

### Libraries
Utilities, data types, and developer tools

Key packages: extended-data-types, directed-inputs-class, lifecyclelogging

## Design Philosophy

1. **Battle-tested** - Every tool solves real production problems
2. **Composable** - Packages work together but don't require each other
3. **Documented** - Clear APIs, examples, and migration guides
4. **Open** - MIT licensed, community-driven development
5. **Honest** - Clear about limitations and trade-offs
